<h3> Summary: </h3>
<p> For this Fitts Law Study, we tested the difference in using a dominant hand versus a non-dominant hand
    on a simple trackpad-movement task.
    We tested three different <b> right handed </b> users' ability to move a mouse using the track pad and click
    different objects of varying widths and amplitudes. Each test subject did 9 sessions of
    15 clicks per hand. The users first did the task with their dominant hand (right)
    and then with their non-dominan hand (left). This study found that users are faster and more
    accurate when using their dominant hand on a trackpad. The results are represented below:
